# Advanced-KeyLogger
- Created an updated version of the Keylogger using Python to not only record keystrokes used on devices, but copies them into a separate file
- Able to record spaces, and special characters as well
- Once the program is stopped or finished running the program automatically send the text file containing the logged keys to a specific email address
- The program signs into the sending email address using the username and password given to it, then sends to a specified address. 

*Requires lambda and SES to use email feature
